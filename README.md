# Learning Hub ðŸ“˜

This is my personal repository for learning and development.  
It includes notes, scripts, exercises, and projects from various courses, tutorials, and self-learning.

## Structure
- `courses/` â†’ Folder for each course (notes + scripts/projects)
- `resources/` â†’ Extra materials like cheatsheets, references
- `misc/` â†’ Random experiments, drafts, and small notes

## Goal
To track my learning journey and have all resources in one place ðŸš€
